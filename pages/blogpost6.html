            <p>Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah <br>
                Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah <br>
                I think I did it again<br>
                I made you believe we're more than just friends<br>
                Oh baby<br>
                It might seem like a crush<br>
                But it doesn't mean that I'm serious<br>
                'Cause to lose all my senses<br>
                That is just so typically me<br>
                Oh baby, baby<br>
                Oops, I did it again<br>
                I played with your heart, got lost in the game<br>
                Oh baby, baby<br>
                Oops, you think I'm in love<br>
                That I'm sent from above<br>
                I'm not that innocent<br>
                You see my problem is this<br>
                I'm dreaming away<br>
                Wishing that heroes, they truly exist<br>
                I cry, watching the days<br>
                Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways<br>
                But to lose all my senses<br>
                That is just so typically me<br>
                Oh baby, oh<br>
                Oops, I did it again<br>
                I played with your heart, got lost in the game<br>
                Oh baby, baby<br>
                Oops, you think I'm in love<br>

                Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have<br>
                Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this?<br>
                Yeah, yes it is<br>
                But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end<br>
                Well baby, I went down and got it for you<br>
                Aww, you shouldn't have<br>
                Oops, I did it again to your heart<br>
                Got lost in this game, oh baby<br>
                Oops, you think that I'm sent from above<br>
                I'm not that innocent<br>
                Oops, I did it again<br>
